                                                Welcome to my portfolio page!!! My name is Marisa and I recently
                                                graduated from
                                                UCLA in June with a degree in Communication.
                                                While I was at UCLA, I spent my time consuming ungodly amounts of boba,
                                                reading
                                                on the pillars of Royce Hall, and hanging out with my friends.
                                                Fun fact, I was supposed to graduate in 2020, but took summer classes
                                                and extra
                                                classes some quarters to graduate a year early.
                                                After graduation, I knew I wanted a job in the tech industry, but
                                                ultimately had
                                                trouble given I didn't have the skillset as many other people did.
                                                I enrolled in UCLA Extension's Coding Bootcamp to bring myself to a
                                                level where
                                                I could be employer competitive as well as learn the extremely
                                                valuable skill that is coding! I've always had a passion for photography
                                                and web
                                                design since high school when I was on yearbook staff.
                                                And now with the skillset that I learned during my coding bootcamp,
                                                I can finally pursue this passion and find a career in web
                                                design/devlopment.
